# JavaScript Practise Repository

This repository should store my JavaScript back-end study content.
It should contain my experiments with JavaScript documentation,
and these experiments should be tested with the Jest framework.
It should also contain exercises, that should also be tested
with that framework.

This repository is linked to a project, which contains all my
back-end study plan, in the form of Kanban.
